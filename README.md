## Project Breakdowns
### 1. Higher or Lower Game (Python) [code](HigherLowerGame.py)
**Description**: The _Higher or Lower Game_ python project is a console-based deck randomization and predicition game. Using a standard deck of 52 cards, the user will have to determine if the next card in sequence will be higher or lower than the currently presented card. The total and correct or incorrect guesses are tracked each round along with the total cards left in the deck.

**Key Features**:
+ Class Implementation
+ Functions to define game logic
+ Comparative loops to determine game sequencing
+ User input and validation

**Implementation and Application**:
To try out the program, download the file above and use an IDE such as [Public IDE](https://www.online-python.com/).

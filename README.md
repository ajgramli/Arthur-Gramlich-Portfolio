## Project Breakdowns
### Higher or Lower Game (Python) [code](HigherLowerGame.py)
**Description**: The _Higher or Lower Game_ python project is a console-based deck randomization and predicition game. Using a standard deck of 52 cards, the user will have to determine if the next card in sequence will be higher or lower than the currently presented card. The total and correct or incorrect guesses are tracked each round along with the total cards left in the deck.

**Key Features**:
+ Class Implementation
+ Functions to define game logic
+ Comparative loops to determine game sequencing
+ User input and validation

**Implementation and Application**: To try out the program, download the file or copy the code and use an IDE such as [Public IDE](https://www.online-python.com/).

### Hypergeometric Calculator (Python) [code](Hypergeometric_Calculator.py)
**Description**: The _Hypergeometric Calculator_ python project is a prompt based calculator that determines the likelihood of a desired outcome from a defined sample. The user is prompted with the name of the sample, what they are looking for, how much they are looking for, the total amount, the attempts to find the sample, and the desired amount. The program uses custom functions to calculate factorials and combinations without relying on external math libraries. It validates user inputs to ensure they are non-negative integers and outputs the probability of achieving the desired outcome as a percentage.

**Key Features**:
+ Calculation functions
+ User input
+ Input to output strings

**Practical Application and Implementation**: Hypergeometric calculators can be tricky to understand but have a wide variety of use cases. They are commonly used in scenarios of sampling without replacement, meaning the population size changes after each iteration. This is useful in genetic analysis, inventory management, or card games like the higher or lower game above. To try out the program, download the file or copy the code and use an IDE such as [Public IDE](https://www.online-python.com/).

### 3. House Sales Dashboard (Tableau) [Resources](Tableau%20House%20Sales%20Resources/)
**Description**: The Tableau _House Sales_ dashboard visualizes monthly data on houses sold in the Seattle area. It utlizies graphs that show sale prices, view quality, number of bedrooms, and more. The distinguishing factor of the dashboard is the interactive filters that allow a user to specify the date of sale, year built, and sizing. 

**Key Features**:
+ Interactive visualizations
+ Geographical mapping
+ Performance metrics

### Data Survey Dashboard (Power BI) [Resources](Power%BI%Data%Survey%Resources/)
**Description**: The Power BI _Data Survey_ dashboard analyzed public survey answers from data professionals from around the world. The dataset was cleaned using Power Query. This project aims to provide insights into various aspects of the data profession through interactive visualizations and comprehensive analysis. 

**Key Features**:
+ Interactive visualizations
+ Salary analysis
+ Power Query utilization
